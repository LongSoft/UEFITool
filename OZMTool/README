OZMTool v0.1
--------------

This program was created to make the process of creating an Ozmosis patched BIOS easier
(If you can handle some terminal commands that is!).
It is based on UEFITool (awesome application!) by CodeRush.
It includes the following useful tools to help you in this process:

        --dsdtextract		Extracts DSDT from BIOS
        --ozmupdate		Updates clean BIOS with files from old OZM-flavoured one
        --ozmextract		Extracts Ozmosis files (ffs) from BIOS
        --ozmcreate		Patches Original BIOS with Ozmosis
        --ffsconvert		Converts kext-directories to FFS
        --dsdt2bios		Injects (bigger) DSDT into AmiBoardInfo

* DSDTExtract
    Extracts AmiBoardInfo.bin and DSDT.aml from supplied BIOS file

* OZMUpdate
    You supply an (old) ozmosis-flavoured BIOS and a recent BIOS for your motherboard and it
    copies over the Ozmosis stuff + kexts (not DSDT because that can differ between Bios Revisions)

* OZMExtract
    Extracts Ozmosis files from a stock (HermitCrabLabs) Ozmosis Bios.

* OZMCreate
    Creates an Ozmosis image from supplied FFS/Kext/DSDT files (Kext & DSDT is optional).
    It uses a several-runs concept for creating enough space to fit the files:
        * 1st run: Try to inject the files as-is
        * 2nd run: Compress big, existing files in BIOS, then inject Ozmosis
        * 3rd run: Deletes non-essential Ozmosis files - keeps the Ozmosis base working tho
            (deletes: ExtFs, HermitShellX64, OzmosisTheme, DisablerKext, InjectorKext)
        * 4th run: Deletes files for BIOS Network Support (PXE etc.)
        If all attempts fail, the output image wont be created (obviously)

* FFSConvert
    Converts files to FFS. It accepts *.kext and OzmosisDefaults.plist.
    Based on Kext2FFS by FredWst! Big thx!

* DSDT2Bios
    Patches (bigger than original) DSDT into AmiboardInfo.
    Based on DSDT2Bios from FredWst! Big thx!
