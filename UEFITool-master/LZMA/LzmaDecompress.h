      Given a Lzma compressed source buffer, this function retrieves the size of
      the uncompressed buffer and the size of the scratch buffer required
      to decompress the compressed source buffer.

      Retrieves the size of the uncompressed buffer and the temporary scratch buffer
      required to decompress the buffer specified by Source and SourceSize.
      The size of the uncompressed buffer is returned DestinationSize,
      the size of the scratch buffer is returned ScratchSize, and RETURN_SUCCESS is returned.
      This function does not have scratch buffer available to perform a thorough
      checking of the validity of the source data. It just retrieves the "Original Size"
      field from the LZMA_HEADER_SIZE beginning bytes of the source data and output it as DestinationSize.
      And ScratchSize is specific to the decompression implementation.

      If SourceSize is less than LZMA_HEADER_SIZE, then ASSERT().

      @param  Source          The source buffer containing the compressed data.
      @param  SourceSize      The size, bytes, of the source buffer.
      @param  DestinationSize A pointer to the size, bytes, of the uncompressed buffer
      that will be generated when the compressed buffer specified
      by Source and SourceSize is decompressed.

      @retval  EFI_SUCCESS The size of the uncompressed data was returned
      DestinationSize and the size of the scratch
      buffer was returned ScratchSize.
