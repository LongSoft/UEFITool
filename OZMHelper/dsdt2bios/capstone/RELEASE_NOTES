Version 2.1.2 is a stable release that fixes some bugs deep in the core.
There is no update to any architectures or bindings, so older bindings
of release 2.1 can be used with this version 2.1.2 just fine.

For this reason, after upgrading to 2.1.2, users do NOT need to upgrade
their bindings from release 2.1.
