This directory contains some tools used by developers of Capstone project.
Average users should ignore all the contents here.


- benchmark.py
	This script benchmarks Python binding by disassembling some random code.

- test_*.sh
	Run all the tests and send the output to external file to be compared later.
	This is useful when we want to verify if a commit (wrongly) changes
	the disassemble result.

- compile_all.sh
	Compile Capstone for all platforms (*nix32, clang, cygwin, cross-compile) &
	report the result as pass or fail.

- fuzz.py
	This simple script disassembles random code for all archs (or selected arch)
	in order to find segfaults.
