Routine Description:

  The CalculateCrc32 routine.

Arguments:

  Data        - The buffer contaning the data to be processed
  DataSize    - The size of data to be processed
  CrcOut      - A pointer to the caller allocated UINT32 that on
                contains the CRC32 checksum of Data

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS               - Calculation is successful.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER     - Data / CrcOut = NULL, or DataSize = 0
